;;; Commentary:

;;  This is something that I might not use if I use Evil or some other modal
;;  editing package.

;;; Code:

(require 'lib)
(require 'general)

;;; The Emacs "Leader" Key and Keymap
;;;

(unless (and (package-installed-p 'evil)
             (bound-and-true-p evil-mode))
  (defvar ctrl-c-map (make-sparse-keymap "CTRL-C Keymap")
    "The keymap for generic key combinations prefixed with Ctrl-c.")

  (general-create-definer emacs:leader-def
    :prefix "C-c"
    :keymap 'ctrl-c-map))



(provide 'keys)
