#+TITLE: My Emacs Config

My personal Emacs setup.

* Inspirations

- [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]]
- [[https://github.com/seagle0128/.emacs.d][Centaur Emacs]]

* My Thought Process

You'll notice a lot of things are taken from Doom, and bits from Centaur Emacs. A lot of helper
functions and hooks I take from Doom, due to letting some better organizing and deferring of packages.

You'll find most of it in ~lisp/lib.el~.

Part of why I move away from Doom is that, while it's a /great/ setup for Emacs, I found the part of
it being a framework made some things a bit more complicated. You're not just having to potentially
debug package errors, you're also having to debug Doom Emacs functions and macros, etc.
And when running into issues, figuring out what is causing the issue becomes a bit more complicated
than it already can be when it comes to Emacs.

I also just wanted something of my own.
